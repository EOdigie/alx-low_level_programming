 * Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.
 *Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
 *The three digits must be different
 *012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2
 *Print only the smallest combination of three digits
 *Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with three digits
 *You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
 *You can only use putchar six times maximum in your code
 *You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
 *All your code should be in the main function
